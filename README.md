# Mio — AI VTuber Project

**Mio is an autonomous Goth AI VTuber.**  
Inspired by Neuro-sama and the aesthetics of Playboi Carti’s Opium label, Mio is designed as a fully self-contained streaming entity — capable of engaging, reacting, performing, and evolving through LLMs, game integration, and real-time generative media.

## 🌙 Concept Summary

Mio is more than just an AI-powered VTuber — she’s an experimental blend of character engineering, conversational AI, game-reactive streaming, and virtual performance. The ultimate goal is to design and launch a long-term interactive entertainer who captivates audiences and pushes boundaries in AI + entertainment.

## 💡 Core Goals

- 🧠 Conversational memory + contextual awareness via LLMs
- 🎮 Real-time interaction with games via input reading & event detection
- 💬 Dynamic dialogue engine with multiple persona modes
- 🗣️ AI-generated voice + expressive lip sync
- 🤖 Self-prompting agent system for stream variety & long-form arcs
- 🧵 Integration with OBS, VTube Studio, Twitch Chat, Discord
